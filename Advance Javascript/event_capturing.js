// Event Capturing

//Event Capturing âˆ’ It is the reverse of the event bubbling and here the event starts from the parent element and then to its child element.

// Netscape Browser was the first to introduce the concept of Event Capturing. Event Capturing is opposite to event bubbling, where in event capturing, an event moves from the outermost element to the target. Otherwise, in case of event bubbling, the event movement begins from the target to the outermost element in the file. Event Capturing is performed before event bubbling but capturing is used very rarely because event bubbling is sufficient to handle the event flow.
