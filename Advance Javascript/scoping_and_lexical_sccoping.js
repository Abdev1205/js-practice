// // 6️⃣ What is Scope Chain and Lexical Scoping in JavaScript? 

// // The scope chain is used to resolve the value of variable names 
// // in JS.

// // scope chain in js is lexically defined, which means that we can 
// // see what the scope chain will be by looking at the code. 

// // At the top, we have the Global Scope, which is the window Object
// // in the browser.

// // Lexical Scoping means Now, the inner function can get access to 
// // their parent functions variables But the vice-versa is not true.

// Lexical scoping is like gunda he can access all the thing of other person  but other person can not access gunda property 

// here gunda is inner function and other function is parent function 


// // For Example 👇

// let a = "Hello guys. "; // global scope

// const first= () => {
//   let b = " How are you?"
 
//     const second = () => {
//       let c = " Hii, I am fine thank you🙏";
//       console.log(a+b+c);
//     }
//     second();
//     console.log(a+b+c); //I can't use C 
// }

// first();
