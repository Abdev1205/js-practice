// 1️⃣ Window is the main container or we can say the 
// global Object and any operations related to entire 
// browser window can be a part of window object. 

// For ex 👉 the history or to find the url etc.

// 1️⃣ whereas the DOM is the child of Window Object




// 2️⃣ All the members like objects, methods or properties. 
// If they are the part of window object then we do not refer 
// the window object. Since window is the global object 
// so you do not have to write down window. 
// - it will be figured out by the runtime.

// For example
// 👉 window.screen or just screen is a small information 
// object about physical screen dimensions.
// 👉 window.location giving the current URL
// 👉 window.document or just document is the main object 
// of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) 
// document object model/DOM.
  

// 2️⃣ Where in the DOM we need to refer the document, 
// if we want to use the document object, methods or properties
// For example
// 👉 document.getElementById()


// 3️⃣ Window has methods, properties and object. 
// ex setTimeout() or setInterval() are the methods 
// where as Document is the object of the Window and 
// It also has a screen object with properties 
// describing the physical display.


// Now, I know you have a doubt like we have seen the methods 
// and object of the global object that is window. But What about
// the properties of the Window Object 🤔

// so example of window object properties are
// innerHeight, 
// innerWidth and there are many more
